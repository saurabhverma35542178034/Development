### **Middleware in Express**

In **Express.js**, middleware is a fundamental concept. It refers to functions that have access to the **request (req)**, **response (res)** objects, and the **next** middleware function in the request-response cycle. Express middleware can be used to modify the request or response, perform operations like logging, authentication, data validation, handle errors, etc.

### **Key Concepts in Express Middleware:**

1. **Request-Response Cycle**: Middleware functions sit between the **incoming request** and the **outgoing response**. They can modify the request, perform side effects, or even terminate the request-response cycle early.

2. **Next Function**: Each middleware function can pass control to the next middleware function in the stack by calling `next()`. If the middleware does not call `next()`, the request will be stuck, and no further middleware or route handler will be invoked.

3. **Middleware Function Signature**:

   ```js
   function (req, res, next) {
     // logic
     next(); // Passes control to the next middleware
   }
   ```

### **Types of Middleware in Express**

Express provides **different types of middleware**:

1. **Application-Level Middleware**: Middleware bound to an **Express application** (applies to all routes or specific routes).
2. **Router-Level Middleware**: Middleware bound to an **Express router** (applies to specific routers).
3. **Built-In Middleware**: Express provides built-in middleware functions like `express.static()`, `express.json()`, etc.
4. **Error-Handling Middleware**: Special middleware to catch and handle errors that occur in the application.
5. **Third-Party Middleware**: Middleware from external libraries, e.g., `body-parser`, `morgan`, `cors`.

### **1. Application-Level Middleware**

This type of middleware is added to the Express app instance. It applies to all routes unless specified otherwise.

#### Example:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// A simple application-level middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request received');
  next(); // Call next() to pass control to the next middleware
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

Here, `app.use()` defines a middleware function that logs every request before passing control to the route handler.

---

### **2. Router-Level Middleware**

You can apply middleware to specific **Express routers** instead of applying it globally to all routes.

#### Example:

```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Router-level middleware
router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Router-level middleware');
  next();
});

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to the router-level endpoint!');
});

// Main app
const app = express();
app.use('/router', router);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, the middleware is applied only to the routes handled by the `/router` router, not to the rest of the application.

---

### **3. Built-In Middleware**

Express provides several built-in middleware functions that are commonly used in Express apps. Some popular built-in middlewares include:

#### **a. `express.json()`**

* **Purpose**: Parses incoming JSON request bodies.
* **Example**:

  ```js
  app.use(express.json());

  app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body); // Access JSON body data
    res.send('Data received');
  });
  ```

#### **b. `express.urlencoded()`**

* **Purpose**: Parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads (from forms).
* **Example**:

  ```js
  app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

  app.post('/form', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body); // Access form data
    res.send('Form submitted');
  });
  ```

#### **c. `express.static()`**

* **Purpose**: Serves static files (like images, stylesheets, and scripts).
* **Example**:

  ```js
  app.use(express.static('public')); // Serve files from 'public' directory

  // If there's a file 'public/index.html', it will be accessible via '/index.html'
  ```

---

### **4. Error-Handling Middleware**

Error-handling middleware is used to catch errors that occur in any part of the application. These middleware functions must have **4 arguments**: `(err, req, res, next)`, where `err` is the error that occurred.

#### Example:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Example of normal middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request received');
  next();
});

// Example of route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  throw new Error('Something went wrong!');
});

// Error-handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);  // Log error stack trace
  res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, the error-handling middleware catches any error thrown by the route handlers and sends an appropriate response with a `500` status.

---

### **5. Third-Party Middleware**

You can integrate third-party middleware for things like logging, authentication, and more. These middleware libraries are commonly installed via **npm**.

#### **a. Morgan (Logging Middleware)**

Morgan is a popular HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js that logs every request made to the server.

* **Installation**:

  ```bash
  npm install morgan
  ```

* **Example**:

  ```js
  const morgan = require('morgan');
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();

  app.use(morgan('dev')); // Log HTTP requests in 'dev' format

  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, World!');
  });

  app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
  });
  ```

#### **b. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**

CORS middleware is used to allow cross-origin requests to your server. It’s commonly used when your frontend and backend are hosted on different domains.

* **Installation**:

  ```bash
  npm install cors
  ```

* **Example**:

  ```js
  const cors = require('cors');
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();

  app.use(cors()); // Allow all origins by default

  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('CORS enabled');
  });

  app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
  });
  ```

---

### **6. Custom Middleware**

You can create custom middleware to suit your application’s needs. Custom middleware is used to handle specific business logic, modify requests, check authentication, or log requests.

#### Example of a Custom Middleware:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Custom middleware to check for an API key
const apiKeyMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  const apiKey = req.headers['api-key'];

  if (apiKey === '12345') {
    next(); // Proceed to the next middleware or route handler
  } else {
    res.status(403).send('Forbidden: Invalid API Key');
  }
};

// Apply custom middleware to a route
app.use('/protected', apiKeyMiddleware);

app.get('/protected', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Protected Route Accessed');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, the `apiKeyMiddleware` checks if the `api-key` in the request headers is valid. If it’s valid, the request proceeds; otherwise, a **403 Forbidden** error is returned.

### **Summary of Middleware in Express:**

1. **Definition**: Middleware in Express is a function that is executed during the **request-response cycle**. It can modify the request or response, or perform operations such as logging, authentication, etc.
2. **Types of Middleware**:

   * **Application-level**: Applies globally to all routes or specific routes.
   * **Router-level**: Applies to specific routers.
   * **Built-in**: Provided by Express (e.g., `express.json()`, `express.static()`).
   * **Third-party**: External libraries (e.g., `morgan`, `cors`).
   * **Error-handling**: Catches errors in the app and sends a response.
3. **Custom Middleware**: You can create your own middleware to handle specific tasks.
4. **Order of Execution**: Middleware is executed in the order it is defined, so the order in which you apply middleware is important.

Middleware is a powerful mechanism in Express, allowing you to handle various concerns like authentication, logging, validation, and more in a clean and modular way.
