useLayoutEffect(setup, dependencies?)

What is useLayoutEffect?
It's a React Hook â€” just like useEffect, but it runs a little earlier in the rendering process.

You can think of it like this:

Hook	When it runs (rough idea)
useEffect()	After React finishes painting (UI shown)
useLayoutEffect()	Before the UI is shown on screen



useLayoutEffect(() => {
  // setup code runs here

  return () => {
    // cleanup code runs when component unmounts or dependencies change
  };
}, [dependencies]);

useLayoutEffect(setup, deps) lets you run code before anything is shown on screen.
It's useful when you need to set things up as early as possible, like setting up a token interceptor for API calls.
