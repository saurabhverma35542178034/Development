When class A uses some functionality of class B, then it is said
that class A has a dependency of class B.

To use class B we need to create its object first
const b = new B()

But what if B also depends on class C, then we need another
object and so on

So, transferring the task of creating the object to someone else
and directly using the dependency is called dependency
injection.
